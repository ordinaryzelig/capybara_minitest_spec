# Capybara MiniTest Spec

Define MiniTest::Spec expectations for Capybara node matchers.

## Description

If you like using Capybara and RSpec, you're used to matchers like:

    page.should have_content('Title')

Now you can have similar functionality while using MiniTest::Spec:

    page.must_have_content('Title')

## Install

    gem install capybara_minitest_spec

## Usage

The gem iterates through all of Capybara::Node's matcher methods and defines these things for each one:

* positive assertion:   assert_page_has_css(page, 'h1')
* positive expectation: page.must_have_css('h1')
* negative assertion:   refute_page_has_css(page, 'h1')
* negative expectation: page.wont_have_css('h1')

### Custom Expectations

If you want to add your own custom page expectations, it's easy.

```ruby
# First define a Capybara session method so that
# page.has_flash_message?(message) is available.
class Capybara::Session
  def has_flash_message?(message)
    within '#flash' do
      has_content? message
    end
  end
end
# Then create a new CapybaraMiniTestSpec::Matcher.
CapybaraMiniTestSpec::Matcher.new(:has_flash_message?)
```

Now you can do `page.must_have_flash_message('Successfully created')`

## Compatibility

In theory, this should work with any version of Capybara, so the runtime dependency is not version specific. At the time of this writing, it was tested with Capybara 1.1.1.


## Testing

This gem was tested by basically copying the Capybara spec located in 'spec/rspec/matchers_spec.rb' and altering the test to run with MiniTest.
Capybara uses xpath as a submodule of the git repository. When adding this gem to gemtesters (http://test.rubygems.org/gems/capybara_minitest_spec), it sounded like too much trouble to check out the submodule, so I just used the regular gem.
